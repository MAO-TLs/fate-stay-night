# Fate/stay night — script browser

Public Japanese/MAO-English reader for the source-reconciled 729-script, 27,530-passage manuscript, with an independently adjudicated audit of the mirror moon English.

The script browser can display mirror moon beside the original Japanese and MAO English. The audit page publishes completed corpus totals, recurring-pattern dossiers, selected cited passages, and counterexamples. The audit evaluates mirror moon independently from the MAO translation and patch.
